# Experienced art director, designer and problem solver with a passion for creativity, simplicity and semantics.​​​​​​​

If we look at the visual identity that use to achieve True North’s job description, we get an insight into the type of organization they want to be associated with moving forward. Illustrated by two very talented graphic designers, the identity is a direct response to the organization’s values and mission, outlined as “giving people a sense of ownership, meaning, ownership and responsibility in their own communities.”

The core identity element is the logotype that replaces the older “T” with the more stylized and illustrative rose, acting as a more corporate logo than a flower. In addition, the rose is used in close affiliation with the interior design of the museum, written in pencil by the museum’s chair, Janet Brown. The rose is also acting as a corporate legend by being engraved in the granite facade of the museum in its own ground-floor window.

>In the creative biz, working with an art director like Chris should be considered a company perk. And that’s coming from a copywriter. Chris is a master of visual aesthetic and can make any ad (or interface), mundane or not, into eye candy. He is a digital craftsman, who can get into the weeds with design, but can also call shots as an art director. — Aidin Massoudi

Using the rose as the logo also creates another reference point for the museum, as it sits right outside the city of Chicago and the museum has a location right off the Loop itself. It allows the brand to become more regional, more Chicagos-y, which is always a winning approach and an important aspect of any brand in-a-while. Another exciting aspect for Second Cup is the color palette, a strong green add our voice to the growing list of blue and orange trending colors.
