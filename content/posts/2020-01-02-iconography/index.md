<div className="Image__Small">
  <img
    src="./images/tall.png"
    title="Logo Title Text 1"
    alt="Alt text"
  />
</div>

These are some of the first icons created to help shape the library as a whole and set our guiding principles: All icons were created on a 32x32 pixel grid with a 2pt rounded stroke.
